      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Craig Monaghan, a self-taught web developer with a passion for
        building clean, functional websites and web applications. I've been
        learning web development through platforms like Codecademy and I've
        spent the last year diving into HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I got into web
        development because I wanted to understand how websites work and how to
        build things from scratch. As I kept learning, I realized how much I
        enjoy the process of solving problems and bringing ideas to life through
        code. Right now, I'm looking for an opportunity where I can grow as a
        developer, work on real-world projects, and contribute to a team. I may
        be at the beginning of my career, but I'm committed, fast-learning, and
        ready to jump in.
